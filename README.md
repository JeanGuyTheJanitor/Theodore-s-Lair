Theodore's lair is a mod for Diablo 1 and Hellfire (Hellfire is recommended) that aims to increase the difficulty of the game and add content.
In Theodore's lair you can meet Nibelung the Dragon and find his helm, the mithy helm of the Nibelungen. This Helm gives great power to the one who use it but beware the dragon...
