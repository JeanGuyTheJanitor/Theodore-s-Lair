<p style="background-color:white;">8 potions allowed per duel (one full belt)</p>
<p style="background-color:white;">One opponent must cast the spell 'Guardian' before a duel; and only until the spell dissipates/concludes may the duel </p>
<p style="background-color:white;">The act of re-equipping items or equipping a new item during a duel is frowned upon because it is known to cause considerable lag (mostly this concerns weapon-swapping during a match, due to a glitch whilst attacking this will cause insta-death for the opponent)</p>
<p style="background-color:white;">During a melee vs. melee duel, non-static combat is encouraged. (e.g. swinging opposite ways once in a while to produce & allow intervals of escape, movement, action and/or correction of desync [or async] - a commendable strategy.. An example of correcting desync during a melee vs. melee duel would simply be described as re-engaging your opponent (I.E. pause combat and walk a tile away from your opponent then back again, then resume combat; or, teleport away and teleport/walk back)</p>
<p style="background-color:white;">Any abuse of the 'mana no-stun bug' is an obvious no-no / Including 'Zen Setup' sorcerers (I.E. using balance, stability & harmony) in conjunction with one another, which is comparable to the 'mana no stun-bug' (Especially if zen is used with 100% fast block) - due to the nature of the effect of both of these 'bugs', this basically enables a sorcerer to practically cast spells through stunlock. Though zen is not as bad of a bug, it's still discouraged. You can find an example of this being tested here: <href>https://youtu.be/nRUVGds2nNY</href></p>

<h2>Lag / Desync:</h2>
<p>In the event of a duel, all players should have little to no expectations for the outcome and results of a single match. This surely raises questions, but here is the answer: you can believe skill definitely takes part in any duel but above all else (at most 85%) Desync & Lag is the major factor. You can be a great Warrior duelist and still lose to a newb Rogue or Sorceror due to delayed damage (caused by high latency/combined lag between all players in a single game) - examples of this can be seen in multiple Diablo 1 PvP videos on YouTube where you would see damage virtually come from out of nowhere.</p>

<p>The other factor is Desync. It ties into Latency/Lag and is the term used to describe what one is seeing on his or her screen while on the opponent's screen is shown something entirely different, or in some cases the total opposite.. Usually, this is a server-side problem (and arguably a problem with Diablo's netcode), not client-side, even though better internet connections exist today.</p>

<p>Sadly, there is no way around it other than adapting to how lag works within Diablo and learning to utilize techniques and strategies that can (in some cases) insure survival and/or a victory. One of these strategies is to be as unpredictable as possible in any duel you might partake in. For example, a Bow Rogue should always stay mobile during any duel to capitalize on their damage output and survivability. If you stay still long enough (even 2-3 seconds or less) you give opening to the opponent and in some instances this can cost you the entire duel. Occasionally, you will just flat-out not see the attack or any character animation at all when dueling another player! This is called Character/Player Lag. Avoiding this is nearly impossible, so staying mobile at all times is very effective when it comes to initializing a defense to problems such as this.</p>

<p>As for Warrior, your worries are much slimmer to some extent. The only problems for a Warrior should be an elemental-bow wielding Rogue or a Sorcerer with splvl20.. Or in some cases, a Warrior might have to face an extremely high AC tank/battle mage or High AC Rogue; in which case this would force the Warrior to equip gold/perfection jewelry which will drastically decrease the Warrior's resources. A Warrior should come out ontop though, if cunning & strategy is properly drawn out 'till the end. In all, Lag/Desync should be the main worry here for all classes regardless of the specific matchup.</p>

<p>*SIDE NOTE* very important - always hold Shift while attacking using Left Click (with a Melee Character) to block arrows</p>

<h2>Tournament-Play:
<p>Usually a tournament will consist of some form of bracket which is a tree-diagram producing the series of duels played during a knockout competition. The type of bracket used most commonly is that of the single-elimination tournament; usually divided between two groups, Example: Group A / Group B which would primarily have the same amount of participants. The way it would work would be: Group A (player1) vs. Group A (player2) - determining who has won most out of the amount of rounds (usually 4 rounds per encounter) the winner would move on to the next competitor in their respective group-bracket. This will continue until 2-4 finalists remain in both groups respectively. At that point they will all face eachother in the semi-finals & third-place playoffs until the last 2 finalists remain in which they would have their final match which would determine the winner of the tournament. In other cases, say, an FFA tournament; a 1st place winner would be determined by points/total kills alone.</p>

        <p>PvP Basics (Melee Focus):</p>
<p>It is imperative for Melee builds to utilize diagonal walk (in moderation) when facing a ranged-attacker. Doing this will help prevent incoming damage, but not always, because of problems like desync. In most occurrences diagonal walk is primarily used to avoid oncoming bombardment and to provide momentary intervals for a preemptive strike or a well-timed escape. Below is an example of how 'walking the line' should be executed.</p>

<p>It should also be made aware that certain angles of maneuvered elemental-bow attacks can prove lethal.. One should not only know of the 'bugged' trapped chests in the dungeons below the cathedral, but also of the 'bugged' arrows similarly experienced during a duel versus a bow rogue. Explained below in this example you will see a bow rogue successfully achieving a 'bugged' arrow strike.</p>

<h2>PvP Basics (Ranged Focus):</h2>
<p>Like Melee class builds, it is imperative for Ranged class builds to always be aware of their surroundings and to also use those surroundings to their advantage. Yet again, in some cases, obstacles like the pillars on Dlvl1-4 or the skull lever cage on Dlvl16 where you will duel can work against you due to desync. On your side of the screen you may be one tile under an obstacle, while on the opponent's screen you are right next to them 2 tiles upward on the opposite end. Mobility is the next key thing here, as mentioned before, staying still can cost you the entire duel. You have to be cautious, as ranged classes may have the highest DPS output in the game they can still be brought down by a few swings of a Warrior's sword or a Sorcerer's lethal Fireball spell. Below is an image of an example of how a Ranged Class can use such an obstacle to their advantage:</p>
