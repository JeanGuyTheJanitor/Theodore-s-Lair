  <h1>Live of the land (LoL)</h1>
  
 <p>In the past, there have been various subclasses created to provide more challenging games. While they have succeeded in this, they tend to often lose some of the flavor of Diablo. This represents our best effort to preserve the flavor of character devolopment while proving a more challenging game. Our goals are: </p>
  
  
  <p>1-Increase the challenge and risk of the game from mormal Diablo</p>
    <p>2-Increase the value of the drops you find</p>
    <p>3-Create a group of continuing characters</p>
    <p>4-Also try to get the Church and Cats in play more as they are in many ways the best two levels in the game (bosses have abilities, etc)</p>
  <p>          </p>
  
  <p>To achieve this we are creating a group of characters to play by a common set of rules. This band uses the tag (LOL) which stands for Live Off the Land The rules are simple:</p>
  
  
  <p>1-No Gold</p>
        <p>     -No buying any items from Gris, Wirt, Adria, or Pepin</p>
       <p>      -No repairs/recharge at Griswald/Adria</p>
        <p>     -No ID's from Cain</p>
    <p>2-No restart after Death</p>
       <p>      -co-op you have to be rescued (i.e. res'd)</p>
       <p>      -solo you have to Start New game and use your equip remaining in your inventory (can't recover items on ground in town) if you have any, and continue the search again.</p>
    <p>3-You may only adventure or trade with other characters who LOL</p>
        <p>     -Also no repairs or recharges from non LOL characters.</p>
        <p>     -Its should be noted that the economics of trading is somewhat different from normal diablo, even potions have value and of the ages is a good suffix.</p>
          
<p>While you can see the similarities to Ironman, there are some major differences.</p>
    <p>     -You keep characters from game to game.</p>
    <p>     -You may retsart new games and clear whatever areas you wish</p>
  <p>     -You may heal at Pepin, after all it is free (however most LOLs choose not to do this</p>
  
  <p>if you want to play on Theodore's lair join our discord server (https://discord.gg/QhYh4bg5dQ) so you can write to other LoL players, trade and organise games.</p>
  <p>when you create a LoL char, after his name write: -LoL.</p>
  
  
  <h1>Ironman rules</h1>
  
  <p>-Solo: You must start a new lvl.1 character. The entire game must be played alone.</p>

<p>-No New Game: You cannot restart a new game to make monsters re-spawn, farm XP and shrines.</p>

<p>-No Escape: As soon as you enter the dungeon, you can't go back. There are a few exceptions to this rule: (i) when you finish a chapter and open the shortcut to town. You can only return to town once per chapter transition (using this method); (ii) using a scroll of town portal that you dropped in the dungeon.</p>

    <p>-This includes quests. If you want to collect reward from quests, either wait for the next chapter or use a TP.</p>

   <p>-You cannot cast town portals from memory, after learning it in a book OR from staffs.</p>

<p>-Backtracking: You can backtrack in order to kill bosses or monsters you skipped.</p>

   <p>-You cannot backtrack to pickup loot you left in previous floors. Pretend everything you left behind when you leave a floor is stolen by goblins.</p>

   <p>-You can still pick up things you just dropped when backtracking.</p>

   <p>-You can leave things in town. Cain is watching over your stuff !</p>
